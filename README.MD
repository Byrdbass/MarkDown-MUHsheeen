# Readme-generator

## Description
This project generates MarkDown files by running 'node index.js' in your terminal. Follow the prompts to generate a professional Readme.md file.  My motivation for this project was to create an easier way to make professional readmes so I can spend more time on coding.
I wanted to solve the problem of helping with the syntax of the markdown file format and make it easy to populate it with information about any future applications I may write.  I learned to use npm packages fs and inquirer as well as how to navigate to different licenses in Github.

## Installation
In order to install this project you will need to run `npm i` in your terminal to get the dependencies in the `package.json`.  After installing the dependencies that will show up as `package.json` you will need to run the program by typing `node index.js` in the terminal to generate the `Readme.md` file.

## Usage
This Project is used for generating MarkDown files. In past projects, making the readme files was often something of a chore getting together all of the information with correct syntax and layout.  This application allows the syntax and layout to be preset, and filled in with content from quick prompts via the inquirer npm for `node.js`

## What-I-Learned
This Project works by running `node index.js` in your terminal.  Then follow the prompts to generate a professional Readme.md file. I learned how to use npm packages fs and inquirer as well as how to navigate to different licenses in Github.
