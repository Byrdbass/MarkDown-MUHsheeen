# Readme-generator

## Description
This project generates MarkDown files by running 'node index.js' in your terminal. Follow the prompts to generate a professional Readme.md file.  My motivation for this project was to I wanted to create an easier way to make professional readmes so I can spend more time on coding.
I wanted to solve the problem of this helps with the syntax of the markdown file format and ease of populating it with information about any future applications I may write.  I learned that I learned how to use npm packages fs and inquirer as well as how to navigate to different licenses in Github.
